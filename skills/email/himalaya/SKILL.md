# Himalaya Email CLI

Himalaya is a CLI email client that lets you manage emails from the terminal using IMAP, SMTP, Notmuch, or Sendmail backends.

## References

- `references/configuration.md` (config file setup + IMAP/SMTP authentication)
- `references/message-composition.md` (MML syntax for composing emails)

## Prerequisites

1. Himalaya CLI installed (`himalaya --version` to verify)
2. A configuration file at `~/.config/himalaya/config.toml`
3. IMAP/SMTP credentials configured (password stored securely)

### Installation

```bash
# Pre-built binary (Linux/macOS — recommended)
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pimalaya/himalaya/master/install.sh | PREFIX=~/.local sh

# macOS via Homebrew
brew install himalaya

# Or via cargo (any platform with Rust)
cargo install himalaya --locked
```

## Gmail Configuration (v1.2.0 — tested working)

**Key discovery:** v1.2.0 uses `auth-type = "password"` at the backend level, with `raw` (the app password) in the nested `[backend.auth]` section. The `raw` variant goes ONLY in the nested auth table, NOT at the backend level.

```toml
[accounts.yourusername]
email = "you@example.com"
display-name = "Your Name"
default = true

[accounts.yourusername.backend]
type = "imap"
host = "imap.gmail.com"
port = 993
encryption-type = "tls"
login = "you@example.com"
auth-type = "password"

[accounts.yourusername.backend.auth]
type = "password"
raw = "your-app-password-here"

[accounts.yourusername.message.send.backend]
type = "smtp"
host = "smtp.gmail.com"
port = 465
encryption-type = "tls"
login = "you@example.com"
auth-type = "password"

[accounts.yourusername.message.send.backend.auth]
type = "password"
raw = "your-app-password-here"
```

**Common errors:**
- `unknown variant 'raw'` at backend level → `auth-type = "password"` goes at the backend level, `raw` goes in the nested `[backend.auth]` table
- `missing field 'auth'` → ensure the nested `[backend.auth]` table exists with `type = "password"` and `raw = "..."`
- For Gmail: use **App Password** (not regular password) from myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

## Hermes Integration Notes

- **Reading, listing, searching, moving, deleting** all work directly through the terminal tool
- **Composing/replying/forwarding** — piped input (`cat << EOF | himalaya template send`) is recommended for reliability. Interactive `$EDITOR` mode works with `pty=true` + background + process tool, but requires knowing the editor and its commands
- Use `--output json` for structured output that's easier to parse programmatically
- The `himalaya account configure` wizard requires interactive input — use PTY mode: `terminal(command="himalaya account configure", pty=true)`

## Common Operations

### List Folders

```bash
himalaya folder list
```

### List Emails

List emails in INBOX (default):

```bash
himalaya envelope list
```

List emails in a specific folder:

```bash
himalaya envelope list --folder "Sent"
```

List with pagination:

```bash
himalaya envelope list --page 1 --page-size 20
```

### Search Emails

```bash
himalaya envelope list from john@example.com subject meeting
```

### Read an Email

Read email by ID (shows plain text):

```bash
himalaya message read 42
```

Export raw MIME:

```bash
himalaya message export 42 --full
```

### Reply to an Email

To reply non-interactively from Hermes, read the original message, compose a reply, and pipe it:

```bash
# Get the reply template, edit it, and send
himalaya template reply 42 | sed 's/^$/\nYour reply text here\n/' | himalaya template send
```

Or build the reply manually:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' | himalaya template send
From: you@example.com
To: sender@example.com
Subject: Re: Original Subject
In-Reply-To: <original-message-id>

Your reply here.
EOF
```

Reply-all (interactive — needs $EDITOR, use template approach above instead):

```bash
himalaya message reply 42 --all
```

### Forward an Email

```bash
# Get forward template and pipe with modifications
himalaya template forward 42 | sed 's/^To:.*/To: newrecipient@example.com/' | himalaya template send
```

### Write a New Email

**Non-interactive (use this from Hermes)** — pipe the message via stdin:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' | himalaya template send
From: you@example.com
To: recipient@example.com
Subject: Test Message

Hello from Himalaya!
EOF
```

Or with headers flag:

```bash
himalaya message write -H "To:recipient@example.com" -H "Subject:Test" "Message body here"
```

Note: `himalaya message write` without piped input opens `$EDITOR`. This works with `pty=true` + background mode, but piping is simpler and more reliable.

### Move/Copy Emails

Move to folder:

```bash
himalaya message move 42 "Archive"
```

Copy to folder:

```bash
himalaya message copy 42 "Important"
```

### Delete an Email

```bash
himalaya message delete 42
```

### Manage Flags

Add flag:

```bash
himalaya flag add 42 --flag seen
```

Remove flag:

```bash
himalaya flag remove 42 --flag seen
```

## Multiple Accounts

List accounts:

```bash
himalaya account list
```

Use a specific account:

```bash
himalaya --account work envelope list
```

## Attachments

Save attachments from a message:

```bash
himalaya attachment download 42
```

Save to specific directory:

```bash
himalaya attachment download 42 --dir ~/Downloads
```

## Output Formats

Most commands support `--output` for structured output:

```bash
himalaya envelope list --output json
himalaya envelope list --output plain
```

## Debugging

Enable debug logging:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug himalaya envelope list
```

Full trace with backtrace:

```bash
RUST_LOG=trace RUST_BACKTRACE=1 himalaya envelope list
```

## Tips

- Use `himalaya --help` or `himalaya <command> --help` for detailed usage.
- Message IDs are relative to the current folder; re-list after folder changes.
- For composing rich emails with attachments, use MML syntax (see `references/message-composition.md`).
- Store passwords securely using `pass`, system keyring, or a command that outputs the password.
